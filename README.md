# Welcome to The Pokemon World Tournament!

# The home for teambased, free for all, pokemon battles!

## This application was made with love using javascript, html, css, Jquery, and Ajax!

## How to play!

1. Assemble your team!
2. Encounter a rival trainer!
3. Battle!
4. Press the "play button" once in battle mode for sick pokemon battle music!

## Important Info

1. You may regenerate new pokemon teams and opponents to battle as many times as you like!

2. Ordering one of your pokemon to attack will initiate battle sequence! Your attack will either damage the enemy teams pokemon or miss! Then the enemy pokemon will counter attack! Each pokemon begins a battle with 100hp, as the battle rages, if a pokemons hp reaches zero that pokemon will faint and will be no longer able to battle! Pokemon hospital coming soon! P.S. pokemon damage will be a random roll integer between 20-60!

Stretch Goals!

1. further implement strategy in the battle mechanic, I would like to have pokemon type factor into my calculation of pokemon damage.

3. SUPER STRETCH: Create a small gauntlet story mode with specific rival trainers and gyms to visit, allow player to accumulate badges upon victory, and include multiplayer. Allow player to retain and level up specific pokemon on their team as well as name them.
